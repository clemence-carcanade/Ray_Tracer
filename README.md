## User Guide

Before running the script, you need to create a virtual environment.

In VS Code:
1. Open the Command Palette (`Ctrl + Shift + P`)
2. Select **Python: Select Interpreter**
3. Choose **Create Virtual Environment**
4. Select **Venv**
5. Choose a Python version

Once the virtual environment is created, run the ray tracer from the project root:

```bash
python ray_tracer.py
```
